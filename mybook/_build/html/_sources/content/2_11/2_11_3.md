# 2.11.3 Grape Processing: Materials Planning and Production (Schuster and Allen 1998)

Welch’s grape processing company has successfully employed linear programming models for optimizing its management of raw materials in its production and distribution of grape juice products. Welch’s, Inc. is owned by a cooperative, the National Grape Cooperative Association, involving 1400 growers of Concord and Niagara grapes in the northern United States. Membership in the cooperative is attractive to grape growers because Welch’s offers a reliable and consistent market for grapes, despite fluctuations in agricultural productivity. <br>
Welch’s plants comprise a vertically integrated industry, handling the acquisition and pressing of raw grapes, the storage of pasteurized grape juice and concentrates, production of jams, jellies, and juice products, and the warehousing and distribution of finished products. The company wishes to maintain consistent taste in its products, although weather and geography account for great variations in grape characteristics (sweetness, color, etc.) from year to year. <br>
Welch’s had a comprehensive *materials requirement planning* system to estimate all the resources needs, from juicing raw grapes to the completion of manufactured products. This, along with a minicomputer based cost accounting system have proved useful, but do not provide optimal cost solutions for the very important juice blending operation; and each run of the system takes so much computational time that interactive real-time use of the system is impractical. Furthermore, whereas most industries try to schedule capacities first and then project their materials requirements, the existing system at Welch’s did not incorporate any consideration of capacities such as juice concentrations or transportation between plants. Without use of operational constraints such as these, it was not possible to choose effectively from among a large set of feasible product recipes and to efficiently schedule inter-plant transfers. Optimal movement of raw materials among plants and optimal blending of raw materials into products was not supported by any formal system, and was dealt with by trial-and-error and with input from the simple cost-accounting system. <br>
An initial attempt at modeling this problem resulted in a linear programming formulation with 8000 decision variables. Preliminary testing of this *juice logistics* model indicated the workability of the formulation. But management, lacking understanding of the model and fearing major software management problems, did not fully support the use of the model. <br>
In response to this, analysts dealt with the software maintenance difficulty by choosing economical spreadsheet software (What’s Best!), which provided convenient interfaces for the model, the analysts, and management. Unfortunately, the 8000 variables overwhelmed this software package. Analysts revised the model by forming aggregate product groups rather than dealing with individual products (e.g., all purple-juice products could be treated as a single aggregate, from a materials standpoint). In this way, the model was streamlined into one having only 324 decision variables. This aggregate view invoked suspicion of yielding misleading and overly simplified inventory projections. Although such concern is probably justified in production planning and disaggregation of end products, it turned out that for purposes of materials planning, this is a perfectly acceptable simplification. <br>
Once this very tractable model was put into regular use, it was realized that the model not only offered a much better structured approach to planning and resulted in significant cost improvements, but it also functioned effectively as a communication tool. Rather than being treated as a piece of special offline data, the optimal solution produced by this linear programming model became a central point of discussion in management meetings and an essential operational tool for the planning committee. The complete acceptance of the model as a legitimate component in decision-making placed Welch’s in a position to make key decisions quickly. A profitable decision was made, for example, on whether to purchase raw grapes on the open market (outside the cooperative) during lean crop years; and the system permits rapid decisions on carrying over inventories of grape juice during record-breaking production years (such as happened in 1991 through 1995), and successfully meeting demand after the harsh winter of 1996 by adjusting product recipes. <br>
The analysts at Welch’s attribute the acceptance and successful use of the linear programming model to their having reduced the original model to a size compatible with spreadsheet optimization. This alleviated difficulties with software support. Furthermore, the resulting smaller model was more understandable to people having various levels of mathematical interest, ability, and appreciation. Thus, the simpler model proved to be the most workable one in actual practice. Future plans call for development of a more comprehensive model, capable of incorporating changes in material characteristics over time.
