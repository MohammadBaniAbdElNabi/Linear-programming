2.4.1 Standard Form of a Linear Programming Problem

In preparation for the use of the Simplex method, it is necessary to express the linear programming problem in *standard form*. For a linear program with *n* variables and *m* constraints, we will use the following standard form:
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>

**maximize**  
$z = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \cdots + c_nx_n$ 
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>
<ul/>

**subject to**  
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 $

$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 $

<p style="text-indent: 15px;">&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;</p>

$a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m$
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

where the variables ($x_1$, $\ldots$, $x_n$) are non-negative, and the constants ($b_1$, $\ldots$, $b_m$) on the right-hand sides of the constraints are also non-negative. We can use matrix notation to represent the cost (or profit) vector ($c$ = ($c_1$, $c_2$, $\ldots$, $c_n$)) the decision variable vector

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

the coefficient matrix  

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

the requirement vector  

$$
  b = \begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  b_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  b_m
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

Then the optimization problem can be expressed succinctly as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & z = cx \\
\text{subject to} \quad & Ax = b \\
& x \geq 0 \\
& b \geq 0
\end{align*}

$$
</ul>

Although this standard form will be required by the Simplex method, it is not necessarily the form that arises naturally when we first formulate linear programming models. Several modifications may be necessary in order to transform an original linear programming formulation (as in Section 2.2) into the standard form.

To convert a *minimization* problem to a *maximization* problem, we can simply multiply the objective function by −1, and then maximize this function. (Recall that there are no sign restrictions on the ( $c_i$ ). For example, the problem of minimizing ($ z = 3x_1 - 5x_2 $) is equivalent to maximizing ( $z = -3x_1 + 5x_2 $). Negative right-hand sides of the constraints can be made positive by multiplying the constraint by −1 (reversing the sense of the inequality).

Equality constraints require no modification. Inequality constraints can be converted to equalities through the introduction of additional variables that make up the difference in the left and right sides of the inequalities. Less than or equal to (≤) inequalities require the introduction of variables called **slack variables**.  For example, $ 3x_1 + 4x_2 \leq 7$  becomes the equality $3x_1 + 4x_2 + s_1 = 7$ when we introduce the slack variable $s_1$, where  $s_1 \geq 0 $. Greater than or equal to (≥) constraints are modified by introducing **surplus variables**. For example, $14x_1 + 3x_2 \geq 12$ becomes the equality $14x_1 + 3x_2 - s_2 = 12$ where $s_2$ is the non-negative surplus variable. Although our notation ( $s_1 , s_2 $) may suggest otherwise, the slack and surplus variables are treated exactly like any other decision variable throughout the solution process. Their final values may be just as interesting to a systems manager or analyst as the values of the original decision variables.

Finally, all variables are required to be non-negative in the standard form. If a decision variable should be unrestricted in sign, then that variable may be replaced by the difference of two new non-negative variables. For example, if ($ x_1 $) is to be an unrestricted variable, then every occurrence of $x_1$ in the objective function or in any constraint will be replaced by $x_1' - x_2''$, where ( $x_1', x_2'' \geq 0$). Then in any solution, the sign of the value of $x_1$ is dependent on the relative values of $x_1′$ and $x_2″$

The reason for placing problems in standard form is that our general solution method will be seen to operate by finding and examining solutions to the system of linear equations ( $Ax = b$ ), with the aim of selecting a solution that is optimal with respect to the objective function.
