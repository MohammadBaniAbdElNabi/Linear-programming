        "A combination of practical insight and technical skill is required in order to recognize _which_ problems can be appropriately modeled in a linear programming format, and then to formulate those problems accurately. Because of the wide variety of problems that can be made to fall into the linear programming mold, it is difficult to give guidelines that are universally applicable to the process of problem formulation. Rather, problem formulation is an art that must be cultivated through practice and experience. Several examples are given to point the way, and to illustrate the creativity that is sometimes helpful in framing problems as linear programs. The exercises at the end of the chapter should then provide some of the practice necessary to develop the skill of formulating linear programming models.\n",

        "A saw mill makes two products for log home kits: fir logs and spruce logs which can be sold at profits of \\$4 and \\$5, respectively. Spruce logs require two units of processing time on the bark peeler and six units of time on a slab saw. Fir logs require three units of time on the peeler and five units on the slab saw. Each then requires two units of time on the planer. Because of maintenance requirements and labor restrictions, the bark peeler is available 10 hours per day, the slab saw 12 hours per day, and the planer 14 hours per day. Bark and sawdust are by-products of these operations. All the bark can be put through a chipper and sold in unlimited quantities to a nearby horticulture supplier. Dried fir sawdust can be directed to a similar market, at a net profit of \\$0.38 per processed log. Limited amounts of the spruce sawdust can be made into marketable pressed wood products, but the rest must be destroyed. For each spruce log produced, enough sawdust (five pounds) is generated to make three pressed wood products, which after manufacturing can be sold at a unit profit of \\$0.22. However, the market can absorb only 60 of the pressed wood products per day and the remaining spruce sawdust must be destroyed at a cost of \\$0.15 per pound. The saw mill wishes to make the largest possible profit, considering the cost of destroying the unusable sawdust.\n",

        "There are many problems that appear to fall into the framework of linear programming problem formulations. In some problems, the decision variable values are meaningful only if they are integer values. (For example, it is not possible to launch a fractional number of satellites or to transport a fractional number of products.) In such cases, the linear programming model is modified by adding the requirement that some or all of the variables must take integer values. This gives rise to an **integer programming** problem.\n",

        "In other cases, the objective function or some of the constraints may be nonlinear functions of the decision variables. When this occurs, the resulting model is called a **nonlinear programming** problem. Nonlinear programming models are generally more difficult to solve than linear programming models, but many practical problems do require such formulations."
