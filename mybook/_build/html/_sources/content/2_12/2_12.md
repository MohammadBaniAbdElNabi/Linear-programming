# 2.12 Summary

Linear programming is a special type of mathematical programming, in which the objective function and the constraints can be expressed as linear functions of the decision variables. Once a problem is formulated as a linear program, it is possible to analyze the model and investigate the nature of the solutions to the problem. Graphical solutions for small problems can be illustrative of some of the characteristics of the solutions. In general, linear programming problems may have a unique optimal solution, multiple optimal solutions, or no optimal feasible solution. <br>
For linear programming problems of practical size, the most widely used technique for obtaining solutions is the Simplex method. Applicable to essentially all linear programming models, the Simplex method provides an efficient and effective means of either solving the problem, or discovering that there is no solution. <br>
Every linear programming problem has a dual problem, which often provides a useful alternative interpretation of the solution to the original problem. The theory of duality also suggests ways in which analysts can determine how sensitive a solution is to minor changes in problem parameters. <br>
Relatively recent research has led to the development of new computational approaches, known as barrier methods, or interior point methods. These techniques can in some cases be used effectively to solve the isolated few problems that had never been successfully dealt with using the Simplex method alone. But more importantly, these newer ideas have been integrated skillfully together with older Simplex algorithms to produce new hybrid software that performs better than any one method used independently.
