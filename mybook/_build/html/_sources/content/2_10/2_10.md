**2.10 Software for Linear Programming**

Now that we are familiar with linear programming models and a fundamental method for solving these problems, we will turn our attention to some practical considerations necessary for solving large linear programming problems on a computer. Because there Linear Programming 65 is quite a selection of commercially available software for linear programming, anyone in a position to choose a software system for personal use (and certainly anyone contemplating developing their own software) should be aware of the various features to be mentioned in this section. In particular, we will briefly describe some important extensions often found appended to the usual Simplex techniques, and some actual commercial systems that are available. We also include a discussion of interior methods that now play an increasingly important role in the practical solution of linear programming problems.
