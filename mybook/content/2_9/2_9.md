**2.9 Revised Simplex and Computational Efficiency**

The amount of computation required to solve linear programming problems with the Simplex method is indeed arduous; in fact, all but the most trivial problems must be solved with the aid of a computer. Several decades of experience with computer implementations of the Simplex method have led researchers and practitioners to develop various improvements and enhancements to the original Simplex method. The result is a refined version of the standard Simplex, called the **Revised Simplex method**. This method makes much more efficient use of a computer’s most valuable resources: CPU computation time and memory space. <br>
Recall that the standard Simplex method performs calculations, at each iteration, to update the entire tableau. Actually, the only data needed at each iteration are the objective function row (to determine the entering variable), the pivot column corresponding to the non-basic entering variable, and the right-hand-side values of the current basic variables (to determine the variable to leave the current basis). Thus, the standard Simplex computes and stores many values that are not needed during the present iteration and that may never be needed. The Revised Simplex method performs the same iterations as the standard Simplex, but the details of its computations have specific advantages for computer implementations. <br>
The standard Simplex method generates each new tableau iteratively, based on the previous tableau. However, the Revised Simplex method takes advantage of the fact that all of the information in any tableau can in fact be obtained directly from the original problem equations, if the inverse of the matrix of basic columns for that tableau is known. And that inverse can be obtained directly from the original equations if the current basic variables for that tableau are known. Note that the Revised Simplex performs the usual selection of an entering and leaving variable at each iteration, but it carries out only those computations necessary to register that selection and to record the current solution configuration. <br>
Readers acquainted with numerical computation will be aware that matrix inversion is itself a nontrivial task, in terms of both computation time and numerical accuracy. <br>
Therefore, instead of recomputing a basis inverse at each iteration, a product form of inverse can be used that allows a new inverse to be computed simply from the previous one. This procedure calls for premultiplying the previous inverse by a matrix that is an identity matrix except in one column. (Only that one column and an indicator of its position in the matrix need be stored explicitly.) Some of the more advanced references listed at the end of this chapter provide a more complete description of product form inverse computation, and of how **re-inversion** can help to maintain accuracy and save storage space. <br>
Although the Revised Simplex method requires some additional bookkeeping that 
would not be needed if the full tableau were maintained, the method typically requires less computation, uses less storage space, and obtains greater numerical accuracy than the standard Simplex method. <br>
Because only the essential data are computed, Revised Simplex has an advantage, with respect to computation time, over the standard Simplex. This advantage is particularly pronounced when the number of constraints is much less than the number of variables because the size of all the essential data (basic columns and right-hand-side constants) is determined by the number of constraints. (Refer to [Simmons 1972] for a detailed operationcount for the Revised and standard Simplex methods.) <br> 
Revised Simplex storage requirements are minimal because it is necessary to store only the basic variables, the basis inverse or its product form, and the constants. The original constraint matrix and objective coefficients can be stored efficiently by the computer’s memory manager on conveniently placed storage devices, along with the premultipliers for the product form inverse, if desired. <br> 
Perhaps the most attractive advantage offered by the Revised Simplex method is increased numerical accuracy. As discussed in **Chapter 1**, an algorithm is called numerically unstable if small errors (through round-off in intermediate computations, for example) can lead to very large errors in the final solution. Both the standard and Revised Simplex methods are numerically unstable, but Revised Simplex avoids some of the potential for instability. There is less accumulated round-off error because calculations are performed on a column only when it is to enter the basis, not at every iteration. Furthermore, computations are applied to original problem data, not to data that have already undergone (possibly unnecessary) computation. <br> 
Typical large linear programming problems have constraint matrices that are very sparse, with a large proportion (often in the range of 95%) of zero values. Revised Simplex performs fewer multiplications involving non-zero elements, since Revised Simplex operates on original (sparse) data, whereas standard Simplex operates repeatedly on the entire tableau and quickly creates a dense matrix out of a sparse one. Thus, by taking advantage of sparsity, the Revised Simplex can reduce the amount of computation and therefore maintain numerical accuracy. <br> 
The advantages described earlier have been observed so consistently that almost all commercial software for linear programming is based on the Revised Simplex method (with product form inverse) for both phases of the two phase method.
