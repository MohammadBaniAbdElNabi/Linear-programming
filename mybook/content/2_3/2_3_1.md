Finding an optimal solution to a linear programming problem means assigning values to the decision variables in such a way as to achieve a specified goal and conform to certain constraints. For a problem with *n* decision variables, any solution can be specified by a point $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. The *feasible space* (or *feasible region*) for the problem is the set of all such points that satisfy the problem constraints. The feasible space is therefore the set of all feasible solutions. An *optimal feasible solution* is a point in the feasible space that is as effective as any other point in achieving the specified goal.

The solution of linear programming problems with only two decision variables can be illustrated graphically. In the following examples, we will see cases involving the maximization and minimization of functions. We will also see situations in which no feasible solution exists, some which have multiple optimal solutions, and others with no optimal solution.

Linear programming problems with more than two decision variables require more sophisticated methods of solution, and cannot be easily illustrated graphically. However, our graphical study of small problems will be helpful in providing insight into the more general solution method that will be presented later.
