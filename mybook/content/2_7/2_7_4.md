# 2.7.4 Analyzing the Optimal Tableau: Shadow Prices

Once the Simplex method has terminated successfully, we find that the optimal tableau contains not only the solutions for the decision variables, but also auxiliary information that can be of considerable use to the analyst. For example, in the top row of the final tableau, the coefficient of the i-th slack variable is the amount by which the final objective function could be increased for each additional available unit of the resource associated with that slack variable. These values are called shadow prices, and represent the marginal worth (or incremental value) of making additional units of the various resources available.

By examining the optimal tableau at the end of Section 2.5, we find a coefficient of 4 for slack variable s₃. This means that the final value of z\* could be increased by 4 for each additional unit of the resource associated with the third constraint. Likewise, the coefficient of 1 for slack variable $s_2$ indicates that z\* could be increased at a rate of 1 for each added unit
of the resource associated with the second constraint.

We are not too surprised to find, in this tableau, a zero marginal worth for the first resource (denoted by a zero coefficient for $s_1$ in the top row). Since $s_1 = 25$ in the final solution, the first inequality constraint is satisfied with a slack of 25; that is, this resource is not being completely consumed in this solution. Therefore, we would not expect any increase in the objective function to result from adding any more units of a resource that is presently already under-utilized.

Decision makers and analysts are usually in a position to know whether the resource limitations (that appear on the right hand sides of the linear system of constraints) are truly fixed or whether resource allocations could be modified by acquiring additional resources. Management can determine the economic advisability of increasing the allotment of the i-th resource by examining the shadow price: the shadow price is the maximum per unit price that should be paid to increase the allotment of that resource by one unit, in order to achieve a net gain in the objective.

Having made the earlier observations about the unit worth of resources, it is important to point out that the increases in resource allocations must be relatively small increases. The economic measure of the value of increasing the availability of any given resource is valid only as long as such an increase does not change the optimal basic solution. When the right-hand sides of constraints are changed, we do in fact have a different linear programming problem. Analyzing the extent to which resource capacities (or availabilities) can be changed without altering the optimal set of basic variables is one of the topics covered in the following section of this chapter.
