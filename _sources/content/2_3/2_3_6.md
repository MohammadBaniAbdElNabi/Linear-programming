# 2.3.6 General Solution Method

We have seen in our graphical solutions that, if an optimal solution exists, it occurs at an *extreme point* of the feasible region. This fundamental property of linear programming problems is the foundation for a general solution method called the **Simplex method**. Because only the finitely many extreme points need be examined (rather than all the points in the feasible region), an optimal solution may be found systematically by considering the objective function values at the extreme points. In fact, in actual practice, only a small subset of the extreme points need be examined. The following sections will demonstrate how the Simplex method is able to locate optimal solutions with such efficiency.
