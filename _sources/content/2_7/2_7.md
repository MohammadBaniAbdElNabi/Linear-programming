**2.7 Information in the Tableau**

Several of the special cases introduced in Section 2.3 may reveal themselves in the Simplex tableau during the iteration phases of the Simplex algorithm. In particular, based on information that appears within the tableau, we can deduce certain characteristics of the linear programming problem being solved. These include linear programming problems with multiple optimal solutions, those with unbounded solutions, and problems having a property known as degeneracy. We will also find information in the tableau that provides insights concerning the roles played by the various resources in the system being modeled as a linear program.
